# Name of the fixed (reference) image channel used for registration
target_channel_name: Phase3D

# Name of the moving image channel to align with the target. If using beads, this is the channel with visible beads.
source_channel_name: GFP EX488 EM525-45

# Method to estimate registration parameters
# "manual" user manually selects matching features
# "beads" automatic detection of bead matches
# "ants" uses ANTs registration with optimization
estimation_method: ants

ants_registration_settings:
  sobel_filter: False # Whether to apply a Sobel filter for edge enhancement before registration

# Settings for affine transformation estimation (applies to all stabilization methods)
affine_transform_settings:
  transform_type: similarity # Type of transform to estimate "euclidean", "similarity", or "affine"
  approx_transform: # Optional initial guess for the 4x4 affine transformation matrix (if None, will be estimated)
